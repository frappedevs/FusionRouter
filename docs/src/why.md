# Why FusionRouter

Navigating through pages should be just an one-liner. Implementing navigation for your UI is nowhere easy, especially for Roblox.

Traditionally, UI navigation in Roblox is done by connecting event to navigation buttons, and have them set page visiblity on click. For project with overly complex page structure, this just doesn't work and will heavily affect productivity of a developer. **You will be writing a lot of boilerplate code**.

FusionRouter is not the first router library, nor is the router library with amazingly good coding. We created FusionRouter to make working with navigations as easy as it seems. To the point where advanced and specific knowledge is not needed. Just need to know how to code.

`:push()`, `:back()` and `:addRoute()`. Developers just need to define possible routes and everything else will be done by FusionRouter.
