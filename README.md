# FusionRouter
UI Routing in Fusion, done with `Fusion.Value`

:warning: Work In Progress! Features are incomplete and bugs may occur.

If you came from web development (React, Vue, Svelte, et cetera). You definitely know **Routers**. That's basically what FusionRouter does! Except paths are just an identier rather than an actual URI, and there is no need for a server to serve the Views.

Of course, you can implement a similar workaround by using `Fusion.New "Frame` and `Fusion.Value` only, but without lifecycles method, it's really hard to clean the current view completely for GC purposes.
