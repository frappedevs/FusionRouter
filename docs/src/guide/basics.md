# The basics

FusionRouter is just a library that is heavily related to Fusion. As long as you know how to use Fusion, the onboarding of FusionRouter shouldn't be that difficult.

For starter, you just need to know the concepts below:
- [Router](./router.md) — the core of FusionRouter
- [Routes](./routes.md) — the way to define pages
- [Navigation](./nav.md) — the base functionality of the router
- [RouterView](./routerview.md) — the object displaying the page content
