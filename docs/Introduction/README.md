# Introduction
As said, FusionRouter is a router library, but, what exactly is a router library?

**A router library, has nothing to do with an internet router.** They are completely different and barely has anything relatable with each other. **A router handles the navigation of routes (pages).** If you came from or is familiar with web development, such concept is pretty much a no-brainer. A router is an essential part in SPA Development (Single Page Application Development).

Of course, porting a SPA concept to a platform that has no such concept about SPA does sound weird and redundant. However, FusionRouter is not designed to emulate/replicate the environment when developing SPAs. Instead, it is designed to make page navigation scalable and easy to maintain, especially when the UI has a huge and complex page structure.

You can pretty much implement the base functionality of a router with just a state, which seemed fine for UIs having 3-4 pages, but when you add things like page title, page icon, navigations, et cetera. Everything becomes a huge mess and you will start hating the code. This is why FusionRouter exists, to solve all those highlighted problem with a lightweight library.
